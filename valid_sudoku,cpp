Statement 34) Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

Example 1:


Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

SOLUTION = class Solution {
public:
/*
This problem looks intimidating in the first glance but we just need to split our solution into three parts:
1. Check if the sudoku board fulfils the row requirement that "Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition."

2. Check if it fulfils column requirement that "Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition."

3. Check if it has the right subbox such that "Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition."

If you scroll down to the bottom, "Constraints" section, you'll find that board[i][j] must be a digit from 1 to 9. So all we need to check is if there is any repitition in row, column, and subbox. To support quick lookups, we can use hashmap, unordered_set specifically. 

A note is that I used two unordered_sets: check_row, check_col in my solution. However, you can just use one, which means that you reuse the unordered_set after part 1 by clearing its content and reusing it for part 2. 

Time complexity is O(1) because the nested for loops will run 81 (9 * 9) times. Space complexity is O(n). 

Since I'm a beginner, I'm still looking for ways to improve the time and memory efficiency of my solution, but I'm sure it's an understandable, though not perfect, solution.

    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {

    for (int row = 0; row < 9; row++){
        unordered_set<char> check_row;
        for (int col = 0; col < 9; col++){
            if (board[row][col] != '.' && check_row.find(board[row][col]) != check_row.end()){
                return false;
            }
            check_row.insert(board[row][col]);

        unordered_set<char> check_col;

            }
            check_col.insert(board[row][col]);
        }
    }

    // 3. Check 3*3 sub-boxes
    /*
    Idea here is that we can break the Sudoku board into 9 subboxes, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, and these box numbers correspond to the index in the vector "check_subbox."

    Then, we need to find a way to determine which subbox an element should go based on its row and col number. We can use a formula: int location = (row/3) * 3 + col/3. This way, we can put the element into the desire box. One example is coordinate [8, 8]. It should be put into the last subbox (subbox 8). By this formula, it should go to (8/3) * 3 + 8/3 = 2*3 + 2 = 8. You can take other examples to verify but that's pretty much the logics.
