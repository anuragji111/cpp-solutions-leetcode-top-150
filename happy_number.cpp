Statement 45) Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false

----------------------------------
SOLUTION = class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;

        while (n != 1 && !seen.count(n)) {
            seen.insert(n); // Track seen numbers to detect cycles
            int next = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                next += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = next; // Update n for the next iteration
        }

        return n == 1; // Happy if it reaches 1, otherwise stuck in a cycle
    }
};
